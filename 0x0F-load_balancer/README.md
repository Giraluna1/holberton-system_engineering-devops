# Install Docker

For this project you will be given a container which you can use to solve the task. If you would like to have Docker so that you can experiment with it and/or solve this problem locally, you can install it on your machine, your Ubuntu 14.04 VM, or your Ubuntu 16.04 VM if you upgraded.

## üßê Background Context

You have been given 2 additional servers:

    gc-[STUDENT_ID]-web-02-XXXXXXXXXX
    gc-[STUDENT_ID]-lb-01-XXXXXXXXXX

Let‚Äôs improve our web stack so that there is redundancy for our web servers. This will allow us to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and to make our infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, we will still have a second one to handle requests.

For this project, you will need to write Bash scripts to automate your work. All scripts must be designed to configure a brand new Ubuntu server to match the task requirements.

  <td>In this first task you need to configure web-02 to be identical to web-01. Fortunately, you built a Bash script during your web server project, and they‚Äôll now come in handy to easily configure web-02. Remember, always try to automate your work!

Since we‚Äôre placing our web servers behind a load balancer for this project, we want to add a custom Nginx response header. The goal here is to be able to track which web server is answering our HTTP requests, to understand and track the way a load balancer works. More in the coming tasks.

Requirements:

- Configure Nginx so that its HTTP response contains a custom header (on web-01 and web-02)
  - The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
  - The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
- Write 0-custom_http_response_header so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task

  - Ignore SC2154 for shellcheck

    <td>Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.

Requirements:

- Configure HAproxy with version equal or greater than 1.5 so that it send traffic to web-01 and web-02
- Distribute requests using a roundrobin algorithm
- Make sure that HAproxy can be managed via an init script
- Make sure that your servers are configured with the right hostnames: [STUDENT_ID]-web-01 and [STUDENT_ID]-web-02. If not, follow this tutorial.
- For your answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
