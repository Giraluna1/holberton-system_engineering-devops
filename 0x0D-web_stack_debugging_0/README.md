# Install Docker

For this project you will be given a container which you can use to solve the task. If you would like to have Docker so that you can experiment with it and/or solve this problem locally, you can install it on your machine, your Ubuntu 14.04 VM, or your Ubuntu 16.04 VM if you upgraded.

## TASK

Be sure to read the Docker concept page

In this first debugging project, you will need to get Apache to run on the container and to return a page containing Hello Holberton when querying the root of it.

Example:

```
vagrant@vagrant:~$ docker run -p 8080:80 -d -it holbertonschool/265-0
47ca3994a4910bbc29d1d8925b1c70e1bdd799f5442040365a7cb9a0db218021
vagrant@vagrant:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
47ca3994a491        holbertonschool/265-0   "/bin/bash"         3 seconds ago       Up 2 seconds        0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   vigilant_tesla
vagrant@vagrant:~$ curl 0:8080
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
vagrant@vagrant:~$

```

Here we can see that after starting my Docker container, I curl the port 8080 mapped to the Docker container port 80, it does not return a page but an error message. Note that you might also get the error message curl: (52) Empty reply from server.

```
vagrant@vagrant:~$ curl 0:8080
Hello Holberton
vagrant@vagrant:~$
```

After connecting to the container and fixing whatever needed to be fixed (here is your mission), you can see that curling port 80 return a page that contains Hello Holberton. Paste the command(s) you used to fix the issue in your answer file.
